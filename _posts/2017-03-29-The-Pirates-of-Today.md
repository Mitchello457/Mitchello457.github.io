TL;DR:

Not everything done on the internet is legal. The most committed crime one that seems to be less obvious than others. It is internet piracy. This acquisition of media is is a touchy subject. Society does not agree on the validity of the following statement: artists make less money because of people who pirate their content. Instead of approaching from the side of the pirated media, streaming services should also be looked at. They pay the artists little to no money, inconvenience the listener, and cut into the other types of revenue that could be made by the artist.

The services offered by companies such as Spotify hurt artists in both the long and short run. Receiving little money per stream does not aid the career of the artist. Neither does it help the listener because they do not own the music. In addition to these, it cuts into the potential money that could be made by the artist from other sources. Streaming may seem like a great idea in theory but it helps no one. It only helps the company itself and it is for this reason that people should view this industry differently than they currently. To save the artists, one simply needs to support the artist personally by donating money or going to a concert where artists receive a lot of the revenue. Society does not realize that to getting their songs into the world generates more money than purchasing them.

TL;DR:

Not everything done on the internet is legal. The most committed crime one that seems to be less obvious than others. It is internet piracy. This acquisition of media is is a touchy subject. Society does not agree on the validity of the following statement: artists make less money because of people who pirate their content. Instead of approaching from the side of the pirated media, streaming services should also be looked at. They pay the artists little to no money, inconvenience the listener, and cut into the other types of revenue that could be made by the artist.

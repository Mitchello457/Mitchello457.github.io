Academic writing is used throughout the world to reach millions of people. It allows for everyone to view, read, and react to the work done by others. This work is out in Academia but is it protected? Some might then ask what does it need to be protected from? The answer to these questions are yes and plagiarism respectively. Many people do not understand that plagiarism is a problem throughout the world. Only a few realize that the largest problem that arises from plagiarism isn't the moral dilemma, but it is that students who plagiarize do not receive a proper education. These people have work done for them and in turn are not being prepared for the outside world.

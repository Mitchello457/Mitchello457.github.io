TL;DR:

The internet is an ocean of information that is available at most people's fingertips. Most people would agree that this is a good thing but it does come with its own set of consequences. One of these consequences is being able to get help too easily in certain situations. Society does not have to figure things out on their own since it is so simple to look up what to do next. This problem is seen in many different positions such as education, video games, and travel.

What would someone do if you were stuck on a homework problem? Most people would open up their web browser and go to <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> and look up the question. If a person is stuck, another person must have had the same problem. This defeats the purpose of homework. An individual is supposed to learn the material. One way that many people learn how to do things is to figure it out themselves.

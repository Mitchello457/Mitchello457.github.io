TL;DR:

The internet is an ocean of information that is available at most people's fingertips. Most people would agree that this is a good thing but it does come with its own set of consequences. One of these consequences is being able to get help too easily in certain situations. Society does not have to figure things out on their own since it is so simple to look up what to do next. This problem is seen in many different positions such as education, video games, and travel.

What would someone do if you were stuck on a homework problem? Most people would open up their web browser and go to <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> and look up the question. If a person is stuck, another person must have had the same problem. This defeats the purpose of homework. An individual is supposed to learn the material. One way that many people learn how to do things is to figure it out themselves. Having so much information available make it easy to just be shown what to do. People when memorize how to do that one specific type of example and ignore what other problems could arise. Nothing is learned; the task is just complete.

Video not are meant to be easy. It is a test of skill that exists to challenge each player. Many players are not adept at playing these games so most games accommodate an easier gameplay for those that are new and a harder gameplay for those that are veterans. However, not all games take part in this practice. One game that does this is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/211420/">Dark Souls<a/>. Everyone plays their first time through the game on the same difficulty. This makes it hard for inexperienced players yet fairly simple for those that have played through the game multiple times. In particular, the hardest part is <a href="http://darksouls.wikia.com/wiki/Blighttown">Blighttown<a/>. As the name suggests, it is full of a poisonous swamp and there are many enemies that will poison you out of no where. It is also very dark in this area. There are three different types of people when faced with Blighttown. There are those that do not care about the game that much die over 10 times in the same spot and many times and never play the game again. There are those that try as many times as needed until the are is complete. The third type are those that die a few times, look up a walkthrough, and complete the area without trouble. This avenue doesn't tech the user how to deal with tough situations. The rest of the game will be much harder since valuable skills were not developed. This was a direct result of the ease of searching the web.

The world is a large place. Too large for many people.

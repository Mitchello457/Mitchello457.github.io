The world of video games is enlightening. These pieces of software encompass an unimaginable amount of subjects and create worlds of their own. Puzzle games are different than the rest in this discipline. There is no overwhelming violence, little blood and gore, and no other humans to be afraid of. The only thing that is to be feared is the lack of knowledge that you have. A puzzle game is an immersive experience that creates an environment with only you and puzzles, builds critical thinking skills, and allows for compelling story telling.

Survival: this word is typically used to describe a man that gets shipwrecked on an island with nothing but him and his soccer ball. Even though this is used correctly, the most important aspect is not used in that prior statement. It is that there are limited resources and no help is coming. One must understand that they are alone. Puzzle games give this feeling. The player is trapped in a room or a corridor and the path may seem simple yet in reality, it is complex. One game that comes to mind is the portal series. Yes, you have GlaDos to keep you company but she doesn't help you. she just monitors your progress. It is you and the test chambers. Each room is a box with a wall or two. It may contain a button or a laser but there are only a few different things to swap out. Nonetheless, these puzzles become extremely difficult and the only way to move forward is to complete the puzzle. The only problem is that you need to be able to use critical thinking skills.

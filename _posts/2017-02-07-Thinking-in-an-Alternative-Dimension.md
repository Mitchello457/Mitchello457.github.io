The world of video games is enlightening. These pieces of software encompass an unimaginable amount of subjects and create worlds of their own. Puzzle games are different than the rest in this discipline. There is no overwhelming violence, little blood and gore, and no other humans to be afraid of. The only thing that is to be feared is the lack of knowledge that you have. A puzzle game is an immersive experience that creates an environment with only you and puzzles, builds critical thinking skills, and allows for compelling story telling.

Survival: this word is typically used to describe a man that gets shipwrecked on an island with nothing but him and his soccer ball. Even though this is used correctly, the most important aspect is not used in that prior statement. It is that there are limited resources and no help is coming. One must understand that they are alone. Puzzle games give this feeling. The player is trapped in a room or a corridor and the path may seem simple yet in reality, it is complex. One game that comes to mind is the Portal series. Yes, you have GLaDOS to keep you company but she doesn't help you. she just monitors your progress. It is you and the test chambers. Each room is a box with a wall or two. It may contain a button or a laser but there are only a few different things to swap out. Nonetheless, these puzzles become extremely difficult and the only way to move forward is to complete the puzzle. The only problem is that you need to be able to use critical thinking skills.

Thinking critically is skill that must be honed the most to be good at puzzle games. This allows you to know what will happen if you change something. One could simple move around with without thinking and solve the puzzles but that would way longer than someone would be willing to spend. Within the game Antichamber, one cannot think like the average human being. One of the puzzles was a fork. You either go up a set of stairs or down a set of stairs. Which way you go is irrelevant. You are simply met with the choice again. This continues forever. Some people would just mindlessly keep going expecting the get out of it. Yet only a few will turn around and see an area that is different from where they came from. Puzzles such as this come up within life. No one wants to stop and look behind them. People just want to keep moving forward. This means that people miss the answer to the puzzle and are not realizing that what they have been trying for hours is not working. This is critical thinking.

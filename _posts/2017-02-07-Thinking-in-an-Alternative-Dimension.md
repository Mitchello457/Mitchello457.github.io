The world of video games is enlightening. These pieces of software encompass an unimaginable amount of subjects and create worlds of their own. Puzzle games are different than the rest in this discipline. There is no overwhelming violence, little blood and gore, and no other humans to be afraid of. The only thing that is to be feared is the lack of knowledge that you have. A puzzle game is an immersive experience that creates an environment with only you and puzzles, builds critical thinking skills, and allows for compelling story telling.

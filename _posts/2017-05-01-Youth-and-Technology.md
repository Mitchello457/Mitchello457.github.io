There is technology almost everywhere in the world. This means that it influences almost everyone on the planet. The people that are most affected are youth. They have been raised in an environment that contained iPhones, 4K televisions, and virtual reality. Technology permeates everything that they do and is always an influence. Is this a good thing? It is impossible to say for certain but what is known is that there is a strong argument for both sides. One view is that children are distracted from the outside world and have weaker social skills while the other states that children are able to grow more through their excessive use of technology.

To many people, technology is a distraction for the youth of the world. Instead of taking a look at the environment around them, children are looking down at an electronic device. Most of the time, this device is a cellular phone that is owned by the parent. Since it is owned by the parent, one would think that there would have to be a restriction on usage but this is is not the case in most families. The child is able to take the phone whenever they want to play games or watch videos which in some cases is a substitute to getting exercise. On a nice day, chi8ldren should go outside and and make friends. They should interact with their fellow human beings instead of being trapped by the phone that they want to play on.

In the same domain, children

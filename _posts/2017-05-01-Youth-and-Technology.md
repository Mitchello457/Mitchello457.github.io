There is technology almost everywhere in the world. This means that it influences almost everyone on the planet. The people that are most affected are youth. They have been raised in an environment that contained smartphones, 4K televisions, and virtual reality. Technology permeates everything that they do and is always an influence. Is this a good thing? It is impossible to say for certain but what is known is that there is a strong argument for both sides. One view is that children are distracted from the outside world and have weaker social skills while the other states that children are able to grow more through their excessive use of technology.

To many people, technology is a distraction for the youth of the world. Instead of taking a look at the environment around them, children are looking down at an electronic device. Most of the time, this device is a cellular phone that is owned by the parent. Many studies have been conducted that come to the same conclusion. The overuse of technology causes children to exhibit social and mental disorders. In 2010, it was found that on average, an elementary aged child used seven-and-a-half hours of entertainment technology per day. Also, three-quarters of these children have a television in the same room that they sleep in. And if that wasn't enough, half of all homes in North America have the television on all day. These three things add up to a sedentary and isolated lifestyle that can lead to heart attacks, strokes, diabetes. All of which have been seen to rise in the youth of the world. On a nice day, children should go outside and and make friends. They should interact with their fellow human beings instead of being trapped in the confines of technology.

Another problem that the youth of their sense of touch should be stimulated and there is no better way than letting them get hurt. Parents want to put their child in a protective bubble where they can never hurt themselves but this actually damages them more. This type of stimulation assists in planned movement as well as prepares them for injuries that thatare able to take a simple forest and turn it into a magical wood that contains weapons and enemies. They work together to fight the forces of evil. They build forts and spend all day using nothing but their mind. This allows for better concentration as well as increased awareness of their surroundings. It even lowers their levels of adrenaline and anxiety to make them generally happier and more calm.

One thing that many young people do not understand is the importance of sleep. One of the leading causes of sleep deprivation is the extended us of technology. Eye strain is a major factor in being able to sleep. One must have eyes that can be relaxed to get a restful sleep. There are many ways to help with this especially on the computer. It is a program called [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) that eliminates the harmful blue light that strains your eyes at night. It also adjust with the time of day to provide the color change when the sun is setting. Another way to avoid blue light is to turn your phone off at night. Not only does it eliminate distractions while you try to sleep, it can create an unneeded source of blue light since most phones have a notification led. An excited brain also prevents sleep. Using technology before bed does not allow the brain enough time to calm down before bed which usually means that the person stays awake for at least thirty minutes before being able to fall asleep. There no program to fix this. A lifestyle change will have to be made. It is recommended by researchers that a person should use no technology for at least an hour before they want to sleep. This allows enough time for the brain to calm down as well as the fact that you cannot strain your eyes if you don't use technology.
